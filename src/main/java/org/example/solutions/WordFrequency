# 192. Word Frequency
# Write a bash script to calculate the
# frequency
#  of each word in a text file words.txt.
#
# For simplicity sake, you may assume:
#
# words.txt contains only lowercase characters and space ' ' characters.
# Each word must consist of lowercase characters only.
## Words are separated by one or more whitespace characters.
# Example:
#
# Assume that words.txt has the following content:
#
# the day is sunny the the
# the sunny is is
# Your script should output the following, sorted by descending frequency:
#
# the 4
# is 3
# sunny 2
# day 1

# Read from the file words.txt and output the word frequency list to stdout.
